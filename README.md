## 9. FAQ

### Can we give an unsorted, randomly ordered arraylist in newuser and newproject or should we sort them like we sorted newprojectuser?
Ans: Only projectuser is asked to be sorted in the specs.


### Importing maps are allowed ?
Ans: NO! You can import java.util.ArrayList, java.util.Stack, and java.util.Queue. You are also allowed to import list, and linked list! (08/10/2019)


### How the correctness of flush query be checked as it does not return anything ?
Ans: The final state of the system will decide whether it had executed correctly, as the completed jobs are printed in the order jobs were executed.


### What do we have to return in timed_user etc. ?
Ans: Return an empty list.


### What is the memory limit of eclipse? How much space are we allowed to use ?
Ans: Don't worry about this, we will ensure that it's executing for majority of the class.


### Do we need to add ID of Jobs as given in the output file in mail?
Ans: It's no required, it's totally optional.





# *Assignment 5* : *Project Scheduler Queries*



Release date: 4th October
Due date: 16th October
submission on Moodle.

## 1. Brief description
This assignment is an extension to the Project Management (Scheduler) part from [assignment 4](https://github.com/manoj2601/Data-Structures-Assignments/blob/master/assignment4.pdf). You are required to perform more complex queries to the scheduler. Details of the commands to be implemented are given below in commands section. (A word about the last command, FLUSH. Suppose a job has sufficient resources but due to its low priority, other jobs with high priority keeps running ahead of it. This would lead job starvation. You give a push to such jobs to run. A way to handle this could be by artificially raising such jobsâ€™ priority.)


## 2. Scheduler Interfaces
You are required to implement the modified scheduler interface mentioned below also attached in ProjectManagement.zip. This is designed to be backward compatible, and an implementation of the original scheduler interface (for Assignment 4) also automatically implements the new interface. Well, almost. You will still need to include the interfaces and default implementations for JobReport_ and UserReport_.


Note that new methods in the interface have the timed prefix. These methods will be timed by the driver code. (You are welcome to modify your driver code accordingly.) Please make sure that the timed methods return as soon as possible with the correct action/answer. This means avoid all extraneous statements (like print) that are not required.


You may only import java.util.ArrayList, java.util.Stack, and java.util.Queue. (Maps are not allowed for assignment 5. Maps will be allowed for assignment 4 tests only.)

## 3. Additional Interfaces
````
interface JobReport_ {

   default String user(); { return null; }

   default String project_name()  { return null; }

   default int budget()  { return 0; }

   default int arrival_time()  { return 0; }

}

interface UserReport_ {

   default String user();     { return null; }

   default int consumed(); { return 0; }

}
````
## 4. Timer
 Here is one way to time execution of a function.
 ````
 public class Timer {

   private long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

   private long elapsedTime = 0;

   public void start() { startTime = System.currentTimeMillis(); }

   public long since() { elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime; return elapsedTime;}

   public long report() { return elapsedTime; }

   public void report(String s) { System.out.println(s + elapsedTime); }

}

## 6. Submission Instructions
As always compress src directory to zip format and rename the zip file in the format entry number assignment5.zip. For example, if your entry number is 2012CSZ8019, the zip file should be named 2012CSZ8019 assignment5.zip. Then you need to convert this zip file to base64 format as follows and submit the b64 file on Moodle.
`base64 entrynumber_assignment5.zip > entrynumber_assignment5.zip.b64`
## 7. Folder Structure
Inside the src directory, you need to have a README.txt or README.pdf (case sensitive) and your solution (exactly following the folder structure of the code provided in assignment 4.). Please do not rename the existing directories. 

## 8. MOSS
Please note that we will run MOSS on the submitted code. Anyone found with a copied code, either from the Internet or from another student, will be dealt as per the class policy

### Note again:
For the description of the queries : http://web.iitd.ac.in/~anz188059/Assignment5.html
- You have to build your own driver code
- Maps (e.g. HashMap) are not allowed
